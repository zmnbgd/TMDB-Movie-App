# TMDB-Movie-App
TMDB Movi App shows a list of the most popular movies


Goal

The goal is to create a simple proof-of-concept app that fetches the data from the API to see the currently popular movies. When the users click on any item, they can see the basic details of the movie.
The API to use is the one in ‘The Movie Db’:

• https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
• https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started
• https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

Requirements

• This is just a proof-of-concept; the design will not really matter.
• Visual improvements or animations are not required.
• Code structure and cleanness are the two main factors to check.
• You are allowed to use any libraries you want to achieve this task.
• Target devices are only iPhones in portrait mode. No specific resources for
other devices or configuration changes are required.
• To retrieve the movies list, use the following
‘api_key’: 93aea0c77bc168d8bbce3918cefefa45.
Do not forget to include it as a query parameter in your GET request.
